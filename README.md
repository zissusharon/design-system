# Melio's Design-System Home Assignment
Welcome to your home assignment repository template 😄👍🏼.  
This repo scaffolds a React + [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) + Typescript project for you so you could focus on your assignment rather than everything around it.

### How to Start
Fork the repository to have your own copy of it, and start working 😁

### How to Run

Install the dependencies
```npm
npm i
```

Run the Storybook
```npm
npm run storybook
```

Now a browser tab should open with the local Storybook.  
In case it doesn't - head over to http://localhost:6006

### Creating Storybook Stories

If this is the first time you're using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), don't worry - here are some advices:
* Read about [stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/whats-a-story)
* Take a look at our demo story in `ExampleComponent.stories.tsx`
* Read more about [writing stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories)

Our purpose with using Storybook is to be able to create an interactive component catalog for the design-system.  
Keep that in mind when working on the stories.
